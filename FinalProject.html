    <h1>My Final Project </h1>
    <p id="lol">Welcome to my Final Project Web Page. Me and my parter have created a program that is like air hockey but instead of air hockey it is called "Air Soccer". We both decided to do this because we are both fanatics of the sport called soccer. The objective of this program is to not let in more than 3 goals in , if you do than the game will end and the person with 3 goals will end up wining the game. </p>  
    Here is my final project game <h2><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-final-project/6642895920742400">Spin-off of "Final Project "</a></h2><script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-final-project/6642895920742400/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
